# Ultimate Fantasy

Ultimate Fantasy is made for game, movie and show lovers alike. It provides a place where users can create there own characters from any game, movie or show that they desire. Then they have the ability to create items and equip their characters with whatever items they choose.

As a user, one will be able to choose from a universal list of items that have been created by all users of the app.

In future developoment, the goal of Ultimate Fantasy is to provide and interface between user characters. This interface will allow users to engage in 'combat' with their respective characters, equipping them with items that will affect there health points, attack and defense attributes.


# GETTING STARTED

To get started, fork or clone this repository: https://github.com/jpersons24/character-select.

*** Make sure to fork or clone the Rails API repository as well before beginning:
https://github.com/jpersons24/character-select-api


The above repository cotains all front end code. Including HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Once you have cd into the repo on your machine, open the index.html file on your desired browser (Ultimate Fantasy was developed using Chrome). At this point you should see the home screen with nothing but a login feature.

If you have a username, type in your username and login. If you do not have a username, simply enter your desired username and click 'login'. An account will automatically be generated for you.

You are now ready to begin creating your desired characters and items. One the upper right hand side of your broswer window, you will see the 'Create Character' and 'Create Item' options. Clicking on either of these options will open the respective forms.

Upon creation, your characters and items will be added to the respective sections of the browser. In order, to equip a character with an item:

- simply choose the character that you wish to equip, the character's flip card should appear centrally on the page
- Hovering over the character's flip card, will reveal the attributes of that character. You will also see a delete option.
- Once you have selected a character and their flip card has been displayed, simply click the item that you wish to equip from the available list.
- The item's flip card will then appear in the central part of the broswer. Hover over the flip card to see the item description as well as the 'add' and 'delete' buttons
- To add the item to the previously chosen character, click the 'add' button
- To delete the item, click the 'delete' button

Once a character has an item added to their inventory, you can remove that item:
- Below the character flip card, you will see an inventory section
- simply find the item you wish to remove from the inventory, and click the 'x' button next to that item



Enjoy your Ultimate Fantasy Experience!!!
